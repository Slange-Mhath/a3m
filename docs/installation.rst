============
Installation
============

a3m is available in PyPI, a software repository for Python projects::

    pip install a3m

We also publish a Docker image that bundles all software dependencies that a3m
needs for a good out-of-box experience. This image is public and can be pulled
from the command line with::

	docker pull ghcr.io/artefactual-labs/a3m:main
